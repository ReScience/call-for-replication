# Call for Replication in ReScience

This is the repository dedicated to the call for replication. If you want to suggest an article for a replication, just open a new issue and give the reference of the original article and possibly the reason you would like to see this article replicated (please refrain from suggesting your own work).

Note that you're also encouraged to [register as a reviewer](https://github.com/ReScience/ReScience/issues/27) such that you can review the replication you've been proposing if someone actually take the challenge.

An issue will be closed once someone declares he will do (or try to do) the replication.
