## Work to Replicate

<!--- Provide a citation for your article, and a DOI if applicable. -->
<!--- If the article is not open access but an author's copy is available, -->
<!--- provide a link to it. -->


## Motivation

<!--- Why is this article interesting to replicate? -->
<!--- You can point to specific features/plots that are particularly interesting -->
<!--- to replicate, rather than the entire article.  -->

<!--- Optionally, you can also explain why you do not do the replication yourself.  -->


## Challenges

<!--- Describe the expected difficulty of the replication. For instance: -->
<!---   * Completeness and accuracy of the description of the algorithms. -->
<!---   * Complexity of the algorithms. -->
<!---   * Is the original code/data accessible? (and its complexity)  -->
<!---   * Are the authors expected to be reachable? -->
<!---   * Anything else you believe to be relevant. -->
